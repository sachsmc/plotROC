plotROC 2.2.1
-------------
Bug fixes: 
  - Quosure fixes to be compatible with upcoming ggplot2 release. 
  - Don't plot points in legend when no labels present (fixes #61)

plotROC 2.2.0
-------------
New features:
  - new cutoff.labels parameter to allow user-supplied labels for the cutoffs (thanks @rcorty)
  - new increasing parameter with default value TRUE. This determines whether the probability 
  of a D = 1 increases with increasing M, if FALSE, assumes that the probability increases with 
  decreasing M (for example if M is the p-value from a regression model) 
Bug fixes: 
  - Now shows shape aesthetic in legend if mapped. 

plotROC 2.1.0
-------------
New feature:
  - cutoffs.at argument to geom_roc overrides n.cuts and plots points/labels at user-supplied cutoffs. 

plotROC 2.1.0
-------------
New feature:
  - max.num.points argument to stat_roc (can also pass it to geom_roc()) limits the number of points that get plotted.
    Note this downsamples the curve at the end of the computation, so the benefit of having a lot of data (very 
    precise curve) is still realized. Thanks @rcorty


plotROC 2.0.3
-------------
Bug fixes:
  - Conflict between alpha.line, alpha.point, size.point and the aesthetics alpha and size

plotROC 2.0.2
-------------
Fixes:
  - Export verify_d function
  - Bug fix for logical vectors passed to verify_d

plotROC 2.0.1
-------------
Bug fixes:
  - Style and format of labels/lines fixed, now passed correctly to ggplot functions
  - Reduce run time of examples
  - Tested with dev version of ggplot2


plotROC 2.0.0
-------------
Major changes to the API this release
  - calculate_roc and ggroc are deprecated
  - estimate and display roc curves using geom_roc
  - estimate and display confidence regions using geom_rocci
  - support for faceting and grouping
  - better performance and improved interactivity. 
  
plotROC 1.3.3
--------------
  - Added support to ggroc method for objects as returned by ROCR::performance
  - Bug fix in labeling
  - Update d3
  - option to omit inclusion of d3 code

plotROC 1.3.2
--------------
Added support for new aesthetic options in plot_journal_roc and export_interactive_roc
  + colors
  + legends
  + line type
  + line width
  + axis labels
  + plotmath expressions in labels

Remove need to specify cutoff labels to plot and export. Those functions now read the data directly from the ggroc object. Easier to use this way!
